The standalone method works on Ephemeris 406 and from astro-phys.com API responses.

To get the Ephemeris 406 data:
1) download all the files at ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ascii/de406/ into eph/406
1B) optionally use the download.lua script, requires wget
2) run the asc2fits.lua script to compress the files

What to run next:

- run solarsystem.lua to see the solar system simulation

- run graph.lua to see the differences of distance or angle between planets
